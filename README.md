# read_13f

This is just a 13f reader I am using to look at some stuff (intentional vagueness). 


If you would like to try some stuff with this I have included some examples in the examples folder.
Just change any instance of "./storage/old_1.txt" to "./examples/old_1.txt" or any of the other example file names.
