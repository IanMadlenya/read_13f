# read_13f

This is just a 13f reader I am using to look at some stuff (intentional vagueness).


If you would like to try some stuff with this I have included some examples in the examples folder.
Just change any instance of "./storage/old_1.txt" to "./examples/old_1.txt" or any of the other example file names.

I have added some documentation if you want to see what the code is actually doing.

*****

- Things I am doing to improve the code
  - Basic documentation of the code (done as of 11/13/17)
  - Generate csv file output (done as of 11/13/17)
  - Menu options to do everything from terminal (have not started)
  - Create the db programmatically (done as of 11/13/17)
  - Better documentation of process (have not started)
  - Remove unnecessary stuff (always in progress)
  - Webpage abstraction of program (maybe when I learn to web)
  - Web Scraper to retrieve the selected 13f filing for a particular cik (done as of 11/16/17)
  - Full instance of going from cik to passing data into db (in progress)
